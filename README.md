# EM_algorithm_poisson_mixture
Implementation of EM algorithm for a mixture of poissons. 

Packages required: numpy, scipy, pandas.

Additional packages required for running the example in the notebook example_EM_poisson.ipynb: tensorflow_probability (I used version 0.16.0 but
as there is nothing fancy I assume other versions will work too).
